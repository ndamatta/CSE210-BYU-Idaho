This  program is a console application that lets users input a list of numbers. It then calculates and displays the sum, average, and largest number from the list.<br>
The program showcases my skills in handling user input, working with data collections, using functions for calculations, implementing control flow with loops, formatting console output, and organizing code in a modular manner.
