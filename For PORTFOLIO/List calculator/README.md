This program allows users to input a list of numbers. It then computes and displays the sum, average, and largest number from the input list.<br>
<br>
After collecting the input numbers, the program calculates the sum using the `ComputeSum` function, the average using the `ComputeAverage` function, and the largest number using the `ComputeLargest` function. The results are then displayed on the console.<br>
<br>
The program demonstrates various programming concepts, including user input handling, list manipulation, looping, basic arithmetic operations, function decomposition, and console output. It demonstrate my proficiency in managing user interactions and performing calculations along with functions.
