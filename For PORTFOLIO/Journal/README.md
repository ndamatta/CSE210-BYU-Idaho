The program revolves around a journaling system that enables users to create, display, save, and load journal entries.<br>
It consists of four classes: Program, PromptGenerator, Journal, and Entry.<br>
<br>
* The `Program` class, functioning as the main program, initializes a journal and prompt generator. It offers a user input loop where choices include writing new entries, displaying existing ones, saving to a file, loading from a file, or quitting.<br>
* The `Entry` class represents a journal entry, encapsulating its date, prompt, and answer, along with a method to display these details.<br>
* The `Journal` class manages entries and displays their details.<br>
* The `PromptGenerator` class generates prompts from a predefined list for entries.<br>
<br>
The program demonstrates various programming concepts: object creation, user input handling, looping, encapsulation, list management, randomization, and file handling. Overall, it serves as a practical example of a journaling application, showcasing the developer's expertise in object-oriented design, encapsulation, user interaction, and file operations.<br>

Also, there is a .PDF file where I planned and designed my ideas and how I wanted the program to work before I actually started coding. Even though the final design ended up a bit different, it worked as a mockup design of the main goal.
