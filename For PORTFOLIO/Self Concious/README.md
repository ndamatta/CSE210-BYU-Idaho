The program's purpose is to offer users a set of interactive activities geared towards relaxation, introspection, and personal development.<br>
It consists of five classes: SelfConcious, Activity, BreathingActivity, ReflectingActivity, and ListingActivity.<br>
<br>
* The `SelfConcious` class acts as the core driver, presenting users with a menu to choose from a range of activities. Users can engage in breathing exercises, reflective sessions, and listing exercises. The program keeps track of activity usage and provides an activity log.<br>
* The `Activity` class serves as the base for various activities. It encapsulates common features like display, duration management, countdown, and input handling. It sets the foundation for specialized activities.<br>
* The `BreathingActivity` class focuses on guided breathing exercises. Users set the duration, and the program alternates between inhaling and exhaling prompts. It offers visual cues and feedback throughout the exercise.<br>
* The `ReflectingActivity` class prompts users to reflect on meaningful experiences. It generates prompts and questions for introspection, persuing personal growth. Randomization adds uniqueness to each session.<br>
* The `ListingActivity` class encourages users to list items based on prompts. Users input responses within a designated time frame, and the program keeps track of the number of items listed.<br>

Key programming concepts showcased encompass object-oriented principles, user interaction, data management, randomization, and time-based interactions. The program underscores my adeptness in creating modular, user-engaging applications that promote relaxation, self-reflection, and personal improvement.
