This program is structured into three classes: ResumeDisplay, Resume, and Job. It simulates a resume display system.<br>
The ´ResumeDisplay´ class contains the Main method, creating instances of Job and Resume classes, populating them, and displaying resume details.<br>
The ´Resume´class holds owner's name and job experiences, with a method to display them.<br>
The ´Job´ class represents job details and has a display method.<br>
This demonstrates my abilities in object-oriented design, composition, method usage, iteration, code organization, and console interaction.
