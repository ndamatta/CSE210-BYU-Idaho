The program consists of three classes: Shape, Circle, Rectangle, and Square, designed to handle various shapes and their areas.<br>
The `Shape` class serves as a base, containing properties for color and name, as well as methods for color setting, information display, and area calculation. The Circle and Rectangle classes inherit from Shape.
<br>
The `Circle` class represents circles, featuring an extra radius field. It overrides the CalculateArea method to calculate the circle's area.<br>
The `Rectangle` class signifies rectangles, having fields for width and height. Similar to the Circle class, it overrides the CalculateArea method for rectangle area calculation.<br>
The `Square` class is present to handle squares. It introduces a side field. It overrides the CalculateArea method to compute the square's area.<br>
The program illustrates various object-oriented programming concepts: inheritance, where properties and methods are inherited from the base class; polymorphism, as seen through method overrides; and class hierarchy, encapsulation, and abstraction. Basic console output is employed to display results. This program demonstrates my proficiency in applying object-oriented principles.
